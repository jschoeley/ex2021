## Introduction

This is a repository to accompany 'Bounce backs amid continued losses: Life expectancy changes since COVID-19'. A link to the open-access version of the paper can be found by clicking [here](). The replication files for this paper include customised functionality written in the [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/) statistical programming language.

## Prerequisites

As a pre-requisite to running this locally, you will need a working installation of [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/) with all of the necessary dependencies installed.

## Running the Code

To run this code, do something like:

```console
git clone https://github.com/jschoeley/ex2021.git
```

and then execute each of the scripts (0 through 10) which will undertake sequential tasks like defining skeletons, to undertaking the PCLM, cleaning outputs for analysis, and data visualisation

## Structure
